# CheckManual

we propose the first manual-based appliance manipulation benchmark **CheckManual**. Specifically, we design a large model-assisted human-revised data generation pipeline to create manuals based on CAD appliance models. With these manuals, we establish novel manual-based manipulation challenges, metrics, and simulator environments for model performance evaluation. Furthermore, we propose the first manual-based manipulation planning model **ManualPlan** to set up a group of baselines for the  **CheckManual** benchmark.
