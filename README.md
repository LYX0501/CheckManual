# CheckManual

we propose the first manual-based appliance manipulation benchmark **CheckManual**. Specifically, we design a large model-assisted human-revised data generation pipeline to create manuals based on CAD appliance models. With these manuals, we establish novel manual-based manipulation challenges, metrics, and simulator environments for model performance evaluation. Furthermore, we propose the first manual-based manipulation planning model **ManualPlan** to set up a group of baselines for the  **CheckManual** benchmark.

### Install SAPIEN Simulator
First, install SAPIEN following

    pip install http://download.cs.stanford.edu/orion/where2act/where2act_sapien_wheels/sapien-0.8.0.dev0-cp36-cp36m-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl

For other Python versions, you can use one of the following

    pip install http://download.cs.stanford.edu/orion/where2act/where2act_sapien_wheels/sapien-0.8.0.dev0-cp35-cp35m-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl
    pip install http://download.cs.stanford.edu/orion/where2act/where2act_sapien_wheels/sapien-0.8.0.dev0-cp37-cp37m-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl
    pip install http://download.cs.stanford.edu/orion/where2act/where2act_sapien_wheels/sapien-0.8.0.dev0-cp38-cp38-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl

Please do not use the default `pip install sapien` as SAPIEN is being actively updated.
